Domain And Problem PDDLs


PDDL-Planning Domain Definition Language 
 is an attempt to standardize Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning languages.
 To get to the solution we use 2 files:
 
  -A Domain file which contains the set up of the problem and the goal of the problem.
 
  -A Problem file where we define which actions our machine can use to get to the goals.
 
 The Planner that I used for this:http://solver.planning.domains/solve
